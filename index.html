                    always striving to learn and grow with those around me. I have worked on a variety of different projects as a full-stack software engineer across several teams, involving a variety of software tools,
                    languages, and frameworks, seeing projects through the full SDLC. I enjoy working as part of a team, listening to and learning from the talented engineers I work with, and where ever possible helping
                    others reach their full potential. To date, I have had the great fortune to work with some extremely talented engineers on complex projects at scale involving backend development, UI development, and

                            Swrve is an integrated mobile marketing automation platform supporting every aspect of mobile engagement, retention, and monetization, including in-app messages,
                            push notifications, email, mobile A/B testing, and mobile analytics. While starting as a backend engineer here, I quickly transitioned into a more full-stack role
                            taking ownership of several complex projects through the backend implementation to the UI and eventual SDK upgrades bringing new and exciting product features into
                            customers' hands. Swrve operates at scale, 24 billion events per day are ingested, and processed in real-time, with SDKs on millions of devices including OTT devices
                            such as smart TVs, there is a large focus throughout the engineering team on code quality, efficiency, and testing. As such I have strived to uphold these practices,
                            designing simple, effective, well-tested solutions to complex business problems. To date, I have worked on a variety of projects, built out several RESTful and GrapQL
                            APIs, designed and implemented ETL pipelines for customers to better extract value from Swrve's data, and expanded on and developed several Swrve's core product features
                            such as embedded messaging, in-app messaging, transactional push, etc.

                              Working closely with a senior member of the SDK team, tasked with building out Swrve's web-SDK and expanding the Swrve core feature set such as push, embedded messaging,
                              in-app messaging, and analytics to the web platform. We started first by designing, prototyping, and building out a web-core module, to collect core functionality into an
                              extendable core module that could also be used as a base for not only web but our OTT platform within Smart-TV such as Tizen (Samsung) and WebOS (LG). Using this web-core
                              abstraction we then proceeded to integrate this as a dependency of our web-SDK. This project has largely been seen as a huge success, with phase one complete; the release
                              of the new web-SDK brings Swrve's core features to customers on the web and the promise of simplifying and speeding up the development of new web-tech SDKs such as smart TVs
                              and other web-based framework abstractions.

                            Worked closely with key stake holders to design and develop a bespoke solution for Agrilands sales manager and team to better manage their customers, sales, and revenue through reporting, insights
                            gathering and b2b interactions. This application also needed to facilitate large scale reporting and deep insights gathering for the news editor and team through simple user querying on the analytics
                            of any given article, set of articles, or timeline on a number of optional parameters. This was achieved through interfacing and collating data from Google Analytics Reporting API (Agriland site) and
                            Googles Firebase Analytics through BiqQuery (Agriland Apps).

                        Being interested in developer tooling, and having identified a bootle neck in Swrve's release process, I set about designing and developing an internal tool that would reduce the overhead of feature development, CI, CD, and the eventual safe release of code into production.
                        This release automation tool was built using Ruby on Rails and automates the creation of feature branches for development, the CI, CD pipeline and the eventual release of code into production. It integrates with tools such as git, consul, and Jenkins and has yielded a 30% increase in speed from
                        development to release. This tool has been a huge success and is currently used by all team members to develop, run CI & CD, and release software safely into production.
