                  <p class="mt-4 text-xs">I am a software engineer with almost 4 years of proven industry experience working in a fast-paced agile environment. I thrive off challenges
                    and difficult problem sets, always striving to learn and grow with those around me. I have worked on a variety of different projects as a full-stack software engineer
                    across a number of teams, involving a variety of software tools, languages, and frameworks, seeing projects through the full SDLC. I enjoy working as part of a team,
                    listening to and learning from the talented engineers I work with, and where ever possible helping others reach their full potential. To date, I have had the great fortune
                    to work with some extremely talented engineers on complex projects at scale involving backend development, UI development, and SDK design &amp; development</p>

                            Swrve is an integrated mobile marketing automation platform supporting every aspect of mobile engagement, retention and monetisation,
                            including in-app messages, push notifications, email, mobile A/B testing, and mobile analytics. While starting off as a backend engineer here,
                            I quickly transitioned into a more full stack role taking ownership of a number of complex projects through the backend implementation to the UI
                            and eventual SDK upgrades bringing new and exciting product features into customers hands. Swrve operates at scale, 24 billion events per day are ingested,
                            and processed in real-time, with SDK's on millions of devices including OTT devices such as smart-TV's, there is a large focus through-out the engineering
                            team on code quality, efficiency and testing. As such I have strived to uphold these practices, designing simple, effective, well tested solutions to complex business problems.
                            To date I have worked on a variaity of projects, built out a number of RESTful and GrapQL API's, designed and implemented ETL pipelines for customers to better extract value from Swrve's
                            data, expanded on and developed a number of Swrve's core product features such as embedded messaging, in-app messaging, transactional push etc.

                              feature set such as push, embedded messaging, in-app messaging and analytics to the web platform. We started first by designing, prototyping and building out a
                              web-core module, with the aim of collecting core functionality into an extendable core module that could also be used as a base for not only web but our OTT platform within
                              Smart-TV's such as Tizen (Samsung) and WebOS (LG). Using this web-core abstraction we then proceeded to integrate this as a dependancy of our web-sdk.
                              This project has largely been seen as a huge success, with phase complete; the release of the new web-sdk bring Swrve's core features to customers on the web and the promise of simplifing
                              and speeding up the development of new web-tech sdks such as smart-TV's and other web-based framework abstractions.
